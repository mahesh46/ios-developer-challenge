1. install pod files
pod 'CryptoSwift'
pod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 4.0'

2. Create model to hold data.
3. not sure what information is required,
so I have only set a few fields in the model. You can add more fields later.
4. Even though there are 20 recods, I am only showing records where the thunmnail is set.
5. This app will work on phones and tablets.
6. If I had more time I would use coredata to record likes against the thumbnailurl as the key.
